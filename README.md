# [<b>House Rocket Insights</b>](https://house-rocket-ds.herokuapp.com/)
## <i>A market share project </i>
https://house-rocket-ds.herokuapp.com/

### 1. Description
House Rocket is a fictional company that works with the purchase and sale. I want find the best business opportunities and my strategy is to buy houses in great condition at low prices and sell those properties at a higher price. 
The attributes of houses make them more or less attractive, influencing the attractiveness of the properties and, consequently, their price. 
The questions to be answered are:

1. Which houses should the CEO of House Rocket buy and at what purchase price?
2. Once the house is owned by the company, what is the best time to sell it and what would be the sale price?
