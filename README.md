## <i>A market share project </i>
https://house-rocket-ds.herokuapp.com/



### 1. Description
House Rocket is a fictional company that works with the purchase and sale. I want find the best business opportunities and my strategy is to buy houses in great condition at low prices and sell those properties with higher price. 
The attributes of houses make them more or less attractive, influencing the attractiveness of the properties and, consequently, their price. 
The questions to be answered are:

1. What are the properties that the company should buy and for what price?
2. What is the best time to sell the property and the best sales price?

### 2. Dataset

### 5. Conclusion
- Properties below the median price and with better conditions were suggested for purchase (total of 151 properties). 
- Properties suitable for purchase were grouped by location and season of the year. 
- The median was calculated and properties with a price below the median had an increase of 10% in their value, while properties with a price above the median had an increase of 30% above their value. 
- The best time to sell properties is in the spring, as the price is higher at that time.
